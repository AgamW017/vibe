In traditional LMS platforms, passive learning and cheating dilute learning outcomes. ViBe introduces **Continuous Active Learning**, where:

- The student is continuously monitored (video + screen share)
- Contextual questions pop up during video lectures
- Unlocks are gated by performance
- AI helps verify engagement and presence

This approach ensures **mastery before progression**.
